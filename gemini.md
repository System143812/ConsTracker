## Your guide
You should base on my coding style and the structure and flow of how I code because I already Implemented the structure of it all you need to do is add and add features and fix bugs as I told you. And also do only what's been told and always ask first before removing a file, or reverting back something, And I already have a database schema there an have sample data for it You can just analyze it all. to understand my whole codebase too just feel free to scan all of the files. I'm about to give you a task, and our style is one at a time and one bug at a time. Understood?
My database schema is in newSchema.txt

Also avoid duplicates, always check after you implement something if it already existing to avoid duplicates
and before applying removal check if it will affect something to avoid something hanging.
